## Python Flask Application Design

## HTML Files
The application will require the following HTML files:

1. **index.html**: The main page of the application. It will contain a form for users to submit their requests. The form will include fields for the task, deadline, and preferred time.

2. **schedule.html**: This page will display the daily schedule generated by the application. It will show the tasks, deadlines, and scheduled times for each task.

3. **style.css**: The CSS file for the application. It will contain styles to format the HTML elements and make the application visually appealing.

## Routes
The application will need the following routes:

1. **Home Page**:
   - Route: "/"
   - Method: GET
   - Purpose: Display the index.html page, which contains the form for users to submit their requests.

2. **Submit Request**:
   - Route: "/submit"
   - Method: POST
   - Purpose: Handle the submission of the form from the index.html page. It will store the submitted data in a database or other storage system.

3. **Generate Schedule**:
   - Route: "/schedule"
   - Method: GET
   - Purpose: Generate a daily schedule for the user based on the submitted requests. It will take into account the deadlines, preferred times, and travel time between tasks. The generated schedule will be displayed on the schedule.html page.

4. **CSS**:
   - Route: "/style.css"
   - Method: GET
   - Purpose: Serve the style.css file to the browser.

## Database
The application will need a database or other storage system to store the user requests and the generated schedules. The database schema will include tables for tasks, deadlines, preferred times, and schedules.

## Conclusion
The above design provides a high-level overview of the necessary components for a Flask application that allows users to submit requests, including deadlines and preferred times. The application will generate a daily schedule minimizing travel time while incorporating the requests. This design serves as a starting point, and additional functionalities and optimizations can be added as needed.
